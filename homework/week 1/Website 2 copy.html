			<p>
				<b>BELLA ZAKARIAN MANCINI</b>
				<br>CREATIVE DIRECTOR
				<br>After growing up in Southern California, I moved to San Francisco to earn my degree in Clothing and Textiles. Soon after, I left for New York City to pursue a career in fashion. For three years I worked in various PR and Marketing roles before putting my education and experience to work in a new field. Always a lover of interior design, I attended NYSID while working as a design assistant at a boutique firm. Two years later I started my company.
				<br>Over the past 20 years my clientele and I have grown together. I am now not only a businesswoman, but also a wife and mother who understands the fast pace of life – especially living in New York City. This firsthand experience in trying to achieve balance has helped me and my team become experts in creating exceptional interiors for real people living busy lives in NYC and beyond.

				<b>TARYN BURNS</b>
				<br>STUDIO DIRECTOR
				<br>Also born and raised in Southern California, Taryn moved to New York City to study Communications and Art History at NYU. With an emerging interest in interiors, Taryn began exploring the field through internships at House Beautiful and various design firms. In 2011 she was introduced to Bella Mancini through a mutual friend and was immediately hired as a design assistant. Over the past 9 years Taryn has worked in various positions and was promoted to Studio Director in 2017. She oversees each Bella Mancini Design project and team member with her uniquely thoughtful and thorough working style.

			<h3>GETTING THE MOST OUT OF YOUR INTERIOR DESIGN PROJECT</h3>
			<p>	
				<br>October 7, 2020
				<br>Projects are successful for three reasons and those reasons aren’t what you think.  
				<br>Sure, everyone wants great design and it’s a given if you’re hiring a designer you want a beautifully designed home.  At Bella Mancini Design the measure of a successful project is not just how pretty it turns out, but how happy the client is living in their home.  How to get the most out of your interior design project is easier than you think.  These simple steps will ensure you love where you live.
			</p>
			<ol>
			<li>Be authentic.  Be honest with your designer about how you live.  Do you eat dinner at your coffee table?  Do your have pets have accidents on the rugs?  Coming clean about all of these things before you start your project will not only safeguard your home, but also your sanity.  We would rather give you a workhorse of a coffee table and a stain friendly rug than have you trying to fit into a fantasy life that isn’t yours.</li> 
			<li>Be thoughtful.  Thinking through the way you move about your home is critical to a successful project.  Is there a place for backpacks to hang?  Will you have a place to leave snowy boots?  Carefully considering modern life will ensure that every room has a function and that there is a solution to every life problem.</li>  
			<li>Be clear.  Taking the time to do your homework in order to clearly communicate your design preferences will save you heaps of time in the end.  You don’t need to know exactly how you want your home to look, but it’s helpful to have some sense of your personal style.  Think about hotels that make you happy, fashion brands that make you feel your best or restaurants where you could sit for hours.  Think about how certain colors affect your mood and, while it sounds negative, think about things you know you really don’t like!  The clearer you can be about these ideas the more confident you can be that your designer understands you.</li>  
			</ol>

			<h3>HOW TO BUDGET YOUR INTERIOR DESIGN PROJECT</h3>
			<p>
				<br>May 20, 2020
				<br>Let’s face it, the elephant in the room is always the budget.  Sometimes a potential new client will call and know exactly what they have set aside for their project but most of the time they don’t have any idea.  Knowing how much you want to spend BEFORE you start calling designers is as important as knowing how much you want to spend before calling a realtor to help you buy a new home.  I realize clients with limited experience might not know exactly how much designing a space will cost, but experience tells me that everyone has a number.  Here’s the thing: there is no right or wrong answer!  Many designers have a project minimum (our office does) which we feel protects the client from having their decorating budget eaten up by design fees and also allows the design firm to prioritize the project.  Figuring out your number can be tricky, but here are some general tips to help you find a range: 
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Are you expecting to do construction? If so, is it a simple paint job or a gut renovation? What do you hope to spend on this part of your project?</li>
				<li>Do you want to add custom built ins? Millwork can really add dimension to a space and value to your home, but is not a small expense.</li>
				<li>Do you want to add motorized window shades or a high-tech sound system? Many clients really value the ease of a high-tech home and understand that it is an investment and one that can require extra construction considerations.</li>
				<li>With decorating, are you excited to invest in showcase pieces and luxurious fabrics?  Had you hoped to have lots of wallpaper or special paint finishes on your walls? Are you expecting to customize your sofas or are you equally happy with an off the shelf product?  Furniture itself has a wide price range and while we always try to balance investment pieces with accessible design items, it’s important to establish intent from the beginning.</li>
				<li>Are you looking for a design experience that is turnkey, with your bookshelves and coffee table filled? If so, that will require a different budget than one where you purchase art and accessories at a more leisurely pace.</li>   
			</ul>
			<p>
				<br>At Bella Mancini Design our projects typically range in a price per square foot for goods only (no fees or construction costs) anywhere from $95-$200 PSF.  That’s a huge range but applies to a lot of different styles of project, from casual weekend house to refined city living.  I encourage you to try that litmus test on your own square footage and see where you net out.   
				<br><br>Most importantly, decorating your home can be a daunting and expensive undertaking and figuring your budget out early on can make the process run much smoother and more efficiently than making it up as you go alone.  Not only will it create fewer headaches, but it will end up saving you money in the long run.

			<h3>HOW TO HIRE AN INTERIOR DESIGNER</h3>
			<p>
				<br>May 8, 2020
				<br>Contrary to what you may think, I always love when I get a call from a potential client who has never worked with an interior designer.  I feel excited about the opportunity to introduce them to a whole new industry and widen their view of their own lives through beauty and great design.  I do know, however, that taking the initial step to hire a designer can be difficult and is often paired with the stress of buying, building or renovating a new home. 
				<br><br>So how do you go about hiring an interior designer?  In New York City there are so many capable and talented designers, it can be hard to know who you would work best with.  It goes without saying that when considering which designers to interview, you should start with those whose work you’re most attracted to.  I don’t believe that a designer’s portfolio needs to speak to you directly (as in, “I want my home to look EXACTLY like that!”) but you should be able to relate to something – color, feeling or just an overall vibe.  
				<br><br>Once you’ve narrowed down the choices to designers whose work you love and/or those who get a glowing review from your friends or family, I suggest doing a deep dive into identifying what’s most important to you in working with someone.  Are you looking to cultivate a long relationship or just get the work done?  Would you rather your designer takes the lead and tell you what to do, or are you or are you more interested in collaboration?  Are you someone who wants to move at a leisurely pace, or do you want someone who works under a set schedule?  Doing this introspective work before you reach out to a designer will help you select someone more quickly.    
				<br><br>After you’ve thought about how you would like to work and have a handful of designers that you want to interview, I encourage you to pick up the phone and speak to each one! A short phone conversation can uncover a lot, so don’t be shy to ask a ton of questions. At Bella Mancini Design, our business primarily comes through word of mouth and past clients, which in my humble opinion speaks volumes about not only our creativity but also our integrity and work ethic.   We recognize that designing a home can be intimidating if you’ve never done it before, so I always try to patiently guide potential clients through our process over <a href="https://www.bellamancinidesign.com/meet-with-bella" style="font-weight: bold">an initial phone call.</a>
				<br><br>I believe that after that first call it is important to take a face to face meeting, ideally in the designer’s office. I like to invite potential clients in to see where we work, who we are, and explain our approach to design and project management and how this has worked in past projects.  It’s fun to show what we are working on and to glean a little more information about what potential clients hope to achieve with their new project.  I always say hiring a designer is a little like having a first date: you really need to click!  You will know quickly if you’re going to want to see one another again and you’re going to spend a lot of time together over the course of many months, so be sure to hire someone you like having around. 
				<br><br>Some things to think about when you meet face to face are:  how interested does the designer really seem in you and your project?  Are they asking enough questions about you and how you live?  If you’re a person who loves processes, do they seem to have solid systems in place that make you feel confident?  If you’re a bottom-line person, how do they submit budgets?  Are they offering to put you in touch with references?  Personally, I love when a potential client speaks with one of our existing clients because it really gives them an idea of what it’s like to work together.    
				<br><br>In the end, hiring a designer should be fun, provide clarity and move at a pace that makes sense for you and your project.  My best advice is to be honest about who you are as an individual or family and how you want to live in your home, don’t be shy to admit that you eat dinner at your coffee table or have never used your oven.  Hire the interior design firm that you connect best with, who you think you will have the best lasting relationship with and the one that will work with the way that you live, not the way that they think you should live.
